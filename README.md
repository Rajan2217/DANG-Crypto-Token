# DANG - A Crypto Token Built on the Internet Computer Blockchain

## Overview

Welcome to the DANG Crypto Token project! This decentralized application (DApp) is built on the Internet Computer (ICP) blockchain, leveraging the Motoko programming language for writing smart contracts, and a React-based frontend for a smooth user experience. The project aims to provide users with the ability to interact with the DANG cryptocurrency by allowing them to claim free tokens, check token balances, transfer tokens to others securely on the Internet Computer blockchain, and use Internet Identity for anonymous blockchain authentication.

## Token

The DANG cryptocurrency is a native token on the Internet Computer (ICP) blockchain. It serves as the utility and governance token for the DANG Crypto Token project. Users can interact with the DANG token by claiming free tokens upon authentication, checking their token balance, and transferring tokens to other users.

The total supply of DANG tokens is fixed at 1 billion, and new tokens cannot be minted. The smart contract governing the DANG token ensures transparency, security, and decentralized token transactions on the Internet Computer blockchain.

## Features

### Curve Finance Clone

To enhance the user experience, this project incorporates a clone of Curve Finance called DSurv made using the React.js framework. Users can easily swap tokens and provide liquidity for the DANG token, thereby participating in decentralized trading and earning rewards.

### Internet Identity

To use DSurv, users need to authenticate themselves through Internet Identity, which is quite similar to Google, Facebook, or any other authentication method. However, Internet Identity is an anonymous blockchain authentication framework supported by the ICP blockchain. It enables users to authenticate securely without revealing their real identity.

### Claim Free Tokens

New users can claim free DANG tokens by authenticating through Internet Identity. After successful authentication, they can claim 10,000 DANG tokens to start their crypto journey. Free tokens can only be claimed once for new users as these tokens are directly transferred from the total supply of the tokens.

### Check Token Balance

Users can check their DANG token balance to keep track of their holdings. The frontend interface will display the user's current token balance fetched directly from the smart contract on the Internet Computer blockchain.

### Transfer Tokens

DANG token holders can transfer their tokens to other users. By providing the recipient's Principle user Id and the number of tokens to transfer, users can easily initiate secure and decentralized transactions on the Internet Computer blockchain.
